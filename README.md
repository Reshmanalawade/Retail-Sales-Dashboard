## Insights

 - Approximately $24.9 million in revenue was generated between January 2020 and June 2022, generating $10.5 million in profit.
 - Mountain-200 Black, 38 has the lowest return rate (2.49%), suggesting strong customer satisfaction.
 - Accessories account for the largest number of orders, specifically with tires and tubes being the most ordered product type. However, a large percentage of the total profit comes from bike sales.
 - Clothing has the highest return rate of all order categories, with shorts being the most returned item. 
 - Customer growth was fairly flat from January 2020 to July 2021 where is suddenly increased. This could be attributed to a sale if it were only seen over one month, but seeing as that new customer number is maintained in proceed months, it's more likely that the spike in customer growth coincided with an event such as a new location opening.
 - While unique customer numbers have increased over this period of time, revenue per customer has been on a steady decline. This could be explained by several factors such as increased inflation as well has post-Covid manufacturing costs going up or product availability being less due to production constraints.
 - The largest spikes in revenue come in the month of December each year, with an average increase of 158 % over the previous month. This is likely due to the Christmas holiday.
